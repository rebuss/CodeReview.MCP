/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>Both methods MUST NOT throw on IO failure — errors are logged at Warning and swallowed.
/// The feature is diagnostic; capture failures must never propagate to the review pipeline.</item>
/// <item>Both methods MAY throw <see cref="OperationCanceledException"/> when
/// <paramref name="ct"/> is canceled.</item>
/// <item>Implementations MUST be safe for concurrent invocation across threads (parallel page
/// reviews dispatch concurrent writes with the same <paramref name="reviewKey"/>).</item>
/// <item>Implementations MUST sanitize <paramref name="reviewKey"/> before using it in any
/// filesystem path — the key is opaque caller-supplied input and may contain characters that
/// are illegal in path components.</item>
/// <item>Implementations MUST NOT write authentication credentials, session tokens, or any
/// security artifact into captured content. Content originates from review prompts/responses
/// which are credential-free by upstream contract; implementations must not attempt to enrich
/// it with any auth material.</item>
/// </list>
