### Codebase Understanding Updates
After applying all code changes and before finishing your response, update `CodebaseUnderstanding.md` to reflect every modification you made: add or remove files in the file-role map, update the model dependency graph, adjust DI registrations, revise conventions when needed, and replace the current file contents for every modified in-scope file. The structure and format of the document must remain unchanged.

### Update README
After applying changes to the project, update the `README.md` and `DeveloperGuide.md` files **only if** the modifications provide meaningful value to the documentation.  
Skip the update if the changes are too minor, overly detailed, or not relevant for end-users.

### Code Quality and Testing Requirements
After modifying or generating code:

- Ensure that existing unit tests still pass and correctly cover the updated behavior.
- If tests fail due to legitimate logic changes, update or extend them accordingly.
- Add new unit tests when new functionality requires coverage.
- Follow Clean Code principles and strictly adhere to SOLID design guidelines in all code you produce or modify.
