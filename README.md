# CodeReview.MCP

Context-aware code review engine designed to support AI on large, real-world pull requests.

> AI is not the bottleneck. Context is.

---

## What this is

CodeReview.MCP is a server that helps AI agents perform code review on large and messy repositories.

It does not compete with AI tools like Github Copilot or Github Copilot CLI.  
It acts as a support layer that prepares the problem for them.

---

## The problem

AI-assisted code review works well for small, clean diffs.

It breaks down when:

- pull requests are large
- repositories are complex or messy
- context does not fit into the model window
- too much input creates noise instead of signal
- important dependencies are missing

In real-world systems, this is the default case.

---

## What this project does differently

### 1. Designed for LARGE pull requests (and messy repositories)

Primary focus.

- handles pull requests that exceed context window limits
- works with multi-project and legacy-heavy repositories
- tolerates inconsistent structure
- does not assume clean architecture

Large and messy codebases are not edge cases — they are the baseline.

---

### 2. Offloads the hardest part from AI

This tool does the work AI is worst at:

- selecting relevant context
- structuring input
- reducing noise
- organizing review flow

Instead of forcing the model to "figure things out",  
CodeReview.MCP prepares the problem for it.

---

### 3. Context selection (not full dump)

- sends only relevant fragments
- expands context when needed
- avoids redundancy

---

### 4. Token-aware processing

- respects context limits
- splits and paginates intelligently
- keeps usage predictable

---

### 5. Deterministic review flow

- metadata → file list → targeted analysis
- avoids random exploration
- enables repeatable results

---

## What this is NOT

- not an AI model
- not a replacement for Copilot
- not a one-click review tool

This is a control layer for AI agents.

---

## Core idea

Better context → better reasoning → better review

---

## 🌐 Language Support

High-signal context enrichment (scope detection, surrounding usings, call sites, language-aware classification) is currently implemented for **C#** only. Pull requests and local changes in other languages are still fully supported, but the AI agent receives them as **plain unified diffs** without language-specific enrichment.

Planned (near-term):

- C / C++
- TypeScript / JavaScript
- F#

Contributions adding analyzers for additional languages are welcome — see `.github/ExtensionRecipes.md`.

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

**Your source code never leaves your machine.**

REBUSS.Pure runs as a **local process** on your workstation. It does not upload, store, or relay your code to any external service. The MCP server acts as a controlled gateway between your AI agent and the data it actually needs:

- **Local processing only** — the server runs on `localhost`; no outbound code transmission occurs.
- **Minimal data exposure** — the AI model receives only **relevant context**, not the full repository.
- **Azure DevOps stays yours** — when fetching PR data, requests go directly to **your organization's** Azure DevOps APIs using **your credentials**. No intermediary services are involved.
- **GitHub stays yours** — GitHub API requests go directly to `api.github.com` using **your personal access token**. No intermediary services are involved.
- **Offline self-review** — local review (`#self-review`) operates entirely without network access. Git operations run against your local repository; nothing is sent anywhere.
- **No telemetry, no tracking** — the server collects zero usage data and phones home to nobody.

> **In short:** REBUSS.Pure gives AI agents *precise, scoped access* to exactly the context they need — and nothing more.

# ⚡ Quick Start

## 1. Install

### Option A — .NET global tool (recommended)

```bash
dotnet tool install -g CodeReview.MCP
```

### Option B - PowerShell

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebuss/CodeReview.MCP/master/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Option C - Bash

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebuss/CodeReview.MCP/master/install.sh | bash
```

---

## 2. Initialize in your repo

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
rebuss-pure init
```

This will:

- ✔ detect your IDE (VS Code → `.vscode/mcp.json`, Visual Studio → `.vs/mcp.json`)
- ✔ generate MCP server configuration
- ✔ copy review prompts to `.github/prompts/`
- ✔ authenticate via Azure CLI (opens browser for login) or accept a GitHub PAT

### Global mode (`-g`)

If Visual Studio does not detect the local `.vs/mcp.json` file in your repository, use the global flag:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
rebuss-pure init -g
```

This writes the MCP configuration to the **user-level** paths (`~/.vs/mcp.json` and `~/.vscode/mcp.json`) instead of the repository-local directories. The global config points `--repo` to the current repository, so it works for any workspace you open.

> **Switching between repositories:** If you use multiple repositories, run `rebuss-pure init -g` in the target repository before switching to it. This updates the global configuration to point to the correct workspace.

> **After updating the tool:** If you run `dotnet tool update -g CodeReview.MCP`, run `rebuss-pure init` again afterwards to refresh the prompt files and configurations to the latest version.

## 3. Review a Pull Request

In Copilot / AI chat:

```
123 #review-pr
```
or use `execute` to force tool invocation:

```
execute 123 #review-pr
```

Where `123` is the Azure DevOps or GitHub Pull Request number.

---

## 4. Self-review local changes

```
#self-review
```

Works **offline** — no Azure DevOps connection required.

---

## ⚙️ Gateway Token Limit

**Override (only if you need a different value):** set `ContextWindow:GatewayMaxTokens` in `appsettings.Local.json` next to the server executable:

```json
{
  "ContextWindow": {
    "GatewayMaxTokens": 50000
  }
}
```

Or via environment variable: `ContextWindow__GatewayMaxTokens=50000`.

When you set this value explicitly, autodetection is skipped — your value wins. Set it to `0` or `null` to disable the cap entirely (use only if your host has no per-response token limit). Per-call `maxTokens` arguments to the MCP tools also bypass the cap.
